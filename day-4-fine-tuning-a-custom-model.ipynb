    "\n",
    "Welcome back to the Kaggle 5-day Generative AI course!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you will use the Gemini API to fine-tune a custom, task-specific model. Fine-tuning can be used for a variety of tasks from classic NLP problems like entity extraction or summarisation, to creative tasks like stylised generation. You will fine-tune a model to classify the category a piece of text (a newsgroup post) into the category it belongs to (the newsgroup name).\n",
    "\n",
    "This codelab walks you tuning a model with the API. [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/tune) also supports creating new tuned models directly in the web UI, allowing you to quickly create and monitor models using data from Google Sheets, Drive or your own files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: We recommend doing this codelab first today. There may be a period of waiting while the model tunes, so if you start with this one, you can try the other codelab while you wait."

         "PB questions...\n\nwell folks, my mac plus finally gave up the ghost this weekend after\nstarting life as a 512k way back in 1985.  sooo, i'm in the market for a\nnew machine a bit sooner than i intended to be...\n\ni'm looking into picking up a powerbook 160 or maybe 180 and have a bunch\nof questions that (hopefully) somebody can answer:\n\n* does anybody know any dirt on when the next round of powerbook\nintroductions are expected?  i'd heard the 185c was supposed to make an\nappearence \"this summer\" but haven't heard anymore on it - and since i\ndon't have access to macleak, i was wondering if anybody out there had\nmore info...\n\n* has anybody heard rumors about price drops to the powerbook line like the\nones the duo's just went through recently?\n\n* what's the impression of the display on the 180?  i could probably swing\na 180 if i got the 80Mb disk rather than the 120, but i don't really have\na feel for how much \"better\" the display is (yea, it looks great in the\nstore, but is that all \"wow\" or is it really that good?).  could i solicit\nsome opinions of people who use the 160 and 180 day-to-day on if its worth\ntaking the disk size and money hit to get the active display?  (i realize\nthis is a real subjective question, but i've only played around with the\nmachines in a computer store breifly and figured the opinions of somebody\nwho actually uses the machine daily might prove helpful).\n\n* how well does hellcats perform?  ;)\n\nthanks a bunch in advance for any info - if you could email, i'll post a\nsummary (news reading time is at a premium with finals just around the\ncorner... :( )\n--\nTom Willis  \\      \\    Purdue Electrical Engineering\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\"Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than lies.\"  - F.

      "You're right, the 1988-1989 Bonneville lineup can be confusing! Here's a breakdown to help you understand the differences:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Model Codes & Features**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **LE:** The base model. Equipped with a 3.8L V6 engine, cloth interior, and basic features. \n",
      "* **SE:**  The \"Sport Edition.\"  Often featured a sportier appearance (possibly with a body kit), upgraded wheels, and could be found with the optional 5.0L V8 engine. \n",
      "* **LSE:**  This is the **Luxury Sport Edition**.  It combined the luxury features of the LE (like leather interior) with the sporty styling of the SE.  It was often equipped with the 5.0L V8.\n",
      "* **SSE:**  The \"Sport Sedan Edition.\"  These were often the top-of-the-line models, featuring performance upgrades like a 5.7L V8, larger brakes, and a sport-tuned suspension.  They also featured luxurious features like leather interior and electronic amenities.  \n",
      "* **SSEi:**  The \"Sport Sedan Edition, fuel-injected.\"  This designation indicates the 5.7L V8 engine was equipped with fuel injection, contributing to better performance and efficiency. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Performance:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **3.8L V6:** This engine was adequate for daily driving but lacked the power of the V8 options. \n",
      "* **5.0L V8:** This engine provided a significant performance upgrade, especially with the optional 4-speed automatic transmission.\n",
      "* **5.7L V8:** This was the top-of-the-line engine.  It was a powerful and robust option, offering significant acceleration and passing power.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Book Value & Market Demand:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, providing a precise book value is impossible without knowing the specific trim level, mileage, condition, and location of the car.  However, you can use online resources like:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Kelley Blue Book (KBB):** [https://www.kbb.com/](https://www.kbb.com/)\n",

      "\n",
      "These websites allow you to input the details of your desired car and receive a fair market value assessment.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Negotiation & Timing:**\n",
      "\n",
      "You're right, early summer is a good time to buy a used car, as dealerships often have inventory to clear out.  However, the market fluctuates.  Be prepared to negotiate and understand that a price below book value is possible, but you might need to be patient and search for a deal. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Tips for Finding a Deal:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Check Private Sellers:**  They often have more flexibility on price than dealerships.\n",
      "* **Negotiate Firmly:**  Be prepared to walk away if you're not happy with the price.\n",
      "* **Look for Cars With Issues:**  These might be discounted, but make sure you can afford the necessary repairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Remember:** The 1988-1989 Bonneville is a great car for its time. Be patient, do your research, and you should find a great deal on a classic American car! \n",

         "REVIEW: 1989 Ford Taurus SHO\n\nReview of 1989 Ford Taurus SHO -- By Gene Kim\n=============================================\n\nBackground:\n\n    Last week, I bought a 1989 Ford Taurus SHO, moving up from driving\na 1987 Toyota Celica ST and a 1975 Oldsmobile Cutlass.  I have been\ninterested in buying a SHO for about five months and have been combing\nthe classifieds in Denver and Chicago every week.  I bought a\nremarkably clean maroon/red SHO with 92K miles on it for $6800.\nAs far as I can tell, this is about $2000 under Blue Book and I still\nhave another 8000 miles before the Extended Service Plan runs out.\n\n    As one should with any pre-1991 SHOs, I made sure that the car was\nalready refit with the upgraded clutch and pressure plate, as well as\nhaving been recalled for upgraded rotors and seatbelt attachments.\nHowever, my SHO does not have the newer rod shifter -- I understand I\ncan get this for $230 from any Ford service center.  In addition, the\ncar received the full tune-up at 60K miles, receiving new platinum\nplugs and valve adjustment.\n\n    For a car with 92K miles on it, the car was virtually immaculate.\nThe clearcoat paint job was devoid of any large chips or dents,\nalthough the front air-dam/molding was covered with lots of small\nscratches -- not surprising since most of the miles were spent on the\nhighway.\n\n    Having driven a smaller two-door coupe for so long, I was a bit\nconcerned about whether I could get used to driving a larger car.  To\nmy surprise, the size of the car doesn't bother me at all -- it seems\njust as nimble as my Celica!  (No comparisons with my Oldsmobile.  :-)\nVisibility from the driver's seat is excellent, helped mostly by of\nthe small the quarter-windows, aft of the back-seat door windows and\nin front of the C-pillar and rear window.  Parallel parking is a bit\nmore difficult, but other than that, I love the size.\n\n    In fact, I'm starting to appreciate the large trunk as I pack up\nfor a 14-hour drive to Washington, DC for the summer.  More on the\nride later in this review.\n\n\nEngine:\n    \n    As with anyone even slightly interested in SHOs, I was very\ninterested in the 24-valve 3.0L Yamaha \"Shogun\" engine.  I was not\ndisappointed.  Base performance of the engine under 4000 rpms is\ngood.  You can even do reasonable launches from second gear, although\nI don't make a practice of this.  The engine revs smoothly and eagerly\n-- tooling around town does not require many shifts.  This is good\nsince the shifter is definitely one of the weakest points of the car.\n(More on this later.)\n\n    While the performance of the engine under 4000 rpms may be\nunremarkable, it undergoes a Jekyll/Hyde transformation once you hit\nhigher revs.  At 4500 rpms, a butterfly valve opens and you can\nliterally hear and feel the geometry of the engine changing as twelve\nmore valves open up.  The engine soars to its 7000 rpm redline, and\nyou are treated to, in my opinion, the sweetest sounding V6 around.\nThe engine inexplicably sounds OVERJOYED to be at 6500 rpm!\n\n    I've noticed that when I drive around town, I constantly watch the\ntach to see how far below 4000 rpm I am.  To go from 2000 rpm to 4000,\nyou may have to punch the accelerator -- while torque is more than\nadequate, it doesn't come fully online until those other 12 valves\nare used.\n\n\nTransmission:\n\n    When _Car and Driver_ first reviewed the car in 1988, they\nmarvelled at how Ford had put such a wimpy clutch and balky shifter\ninto the car.  I remember driving a friend's parent's SHO in 1990, and\nremember thinking about whether I had the leg strength to drive the\ncar in traffic -- the clutch was that stiff.  That was back then.\n\n    The entire clutch assembly on my SHO has been replaced under a\nFord recall in 1991.  The clutch on the SHO feels no stiffer than the\none on my Toyota Celica.  In fact, the friction point seems a bit\nlarger and more forgiving.\n\n    When playing with the shifter with the car parked, the shifter\nfelt very reasonable.  The 1-2 and 3-4 gates were where you'd expect\nit to be, and the shifting action was smooth.  On the road, it's\nmuch the same -- but you have to shift SLOWLY!  Make no mistake, it's\na clumsy shifter.\n\n    When hurrying shifts, like when I was initially trying to impress\nfriends, I consistently miss the 1-2 shift, often grope clumsily for\nthe 2-3 shift, and sometimes even muff the 3-4 shift.  I find this\npretty amazing in a car like this.\n\n    It also took me several days to realize that you get the smoothest\nshifts when you take your time.  Seems obvious, but compared to my\nToyota and my friend's Honda, this seems atrocious and clumsy.\nSomeone on rec.autos noted that CRXs should blow SHOs off-the-line\nbecause of the incredibly clumsy shifter.\n\n    I now shift much more sedately, and the shifter seems more\nreasonable.  When you play within these bounds, the shifter works\nsmoothly with no surprises.  I don't know whether the rod shifter\nupgrade would help at all.\n\n    Along these same lines, I initially had trouble shifting gears\nsmoothly.  Again, slowing down the shifts and taking more care to\nmatch revs when letting out the clutch helped immensely.  This took\nseveral days for me to get the hang of.  (I think some of my problems\nwere because I've never had a car with enough power to balk at bad\nshifts in higher gears.)\n\n    Occasionally, I have trouble shifting into reverse.  The shifter\nrefuses to enter the gate, and I often grind the synchros trying to \nget it into gear.  I'll be watching this carefully in the next couple\nof months.\n\n    A quirk:  When I upshift and the engine drops back to 1000-2500\nrpm, I hear a whirring and then a grinding noise coming from the the\nengine compartment.  Not terribly loud, but the passenger can\ndefinitely hear it.  I asked about it when I was looking at the car,\nas do all my passengers.  Apparently, this is a definitely a \"SHO\nsound\" and is the gearbox -- apparently called \"gear rollover\".\nReplies to my queries on rec.autos are at the end of this review.\n\n\nExterior:\n\n    As I mentioned before, I am astounded by how well the body of this\nSHO has stood up.  Paint chipping on the front bumper and grille are\nvirtually non-existent.  Looking at how older Tauri sometimes\ndon't age so gracefully, I wonder what the guys at Ford did\ndifferently to the SHO bodies.\n\n    The body, in my opinion, is extremely attractive with matching\ncolor body moldings than the stock Tauri.  For some odd reason, the\nSHO seems different enough from vanilla Tauri to get stares at\nstoplights -- of course, this could be my overactive imagination.\n:-)  SHOs get fog lights, a more open grille, a completely\nmonochromatic exterior, and a deeper ground skirt in the back with\n\"SHO\" stenciled in relief.  I've seen a couple SHOs whose owners have\ncolored these in with florescent colors or in black.  Yuck.\n\n    I don't think the car is flashy.  I like it that way.  I feel\nalmost anonymous with all those Tauri out there, but different and\ndistinctive enough to those of us who care.  :-)\n\n\nInterior:\n\n    The interior is what really makes me feel like I don't deserve the\ncar.  The seats are grey leather, the steering wheel and shifter are\ncovered with black leather, and the entire instrument panel is done in\na black/grey/metallic scheme.  \n\n    The instrumentation is stock Taurus, except for the 140 mph speedo\nand 8000 rpm tach.  You get a center console with two cupholders, a\nlarge compartment under the radio (great for a CD player), an armrest\nthat contains yet another compartment, three appropriately sized coin\nholders for tollways (I think), and a compartment for holding\ncassette tapes.  There's map-holders in the doors, and an oddly small\nglove compartment.\n\n    I spilled a whole can of Coke in the cupholder and was delighted\nto find that the entire rubber holder can be removed and washed in a\nsink.  Hey, I'm really impressed with the ergonomics and\nthoughtfulness that went into its design.  And it's a 1989, before the\ninterior was upgraded!\n\n    The backseat is bigger than any car I've had.  Why do they need so\nmuch space?  :-)  (No smart-ass comments, please.  :-)\n\n    The driver and passenger seat have lumbar and side bolsters.  From\nwhat I hear, it's not uncommon for the side bolsters to show wear.\nMine is no exception.  The left side bolster on the driver's has\ncracked and I'm not convinced the right bolster is inflating all the\nway.\n\n    A big surprise for me:  I forgot that SHOs don't have a normal\nhand parking brake.  Instead, they have the regular parking brake that\nyou press with your left foot.  Too bad.  Again, I'm getting used to\nit, but it seems a bit anachronistic to me.\n\n\nRide:\n\n    The suspension is nice and stiff.  Too stiff?  It's stiffer than\nany car I've had.  A friend's new 1993 Toyota Celica ST seems tauter\nand is still able to soak up bumps better.  The SHO seems stiffer with\nless ability to soak up bumps.  Driving over railroad tracks is a\nnoisy and jarring affair.  On the other hand, taking turns feels\nwonderful because the body is so rigid and doesn't flex at all -- I\nlistened for that before I bought the car.\n\n    On the highway, the ride is great.  When I drove the car from\nChicago back to Purdue, I had trouble keeping under 85 mph, let alone\nfrom trying to see what 100 mph really feels like.  It's a relatively\nquiet ride, but the sunroof rattles.  I've tried to find out what\nexactly makes all the noise up there, but it seems to be the window\nthat rests on the rails.  No easy way to get rid of it, I think.\n\n    Over the past three days, I've oscillated between thinking the\nsuspension is wonderful and perfect and thinking that the ride is way\ntoo rough.  (Not for me, mind you.  But I wonder whether I would\nadvise my dad to buy one for himself.)  But, I've discovered, as with\nthe shifter, if you take your time with shifts, you'll have no reason\nto complain.  Let me explain...\n\n    The ride is worst when turning and applying lots of power to the\nwheels.  I feel the wheels scrabbling for traction and torque steer\nmaking the car skitter left and right.  After I understood this, I\navoid the limits of traction -- and I'm a happy camper again.\n\n    It's not body rigidity, but the composure of the car.\n\n    As if matching the suspension, the steering feel is quite heavy.\nMy first impression of driving my SHO was how hard you had to turn the\nwheel at highway speeds.  It tracks straight as an arrow, but when\ndriving around a parking lot, the high-effort steering didn't seem so\nuseful.  However, it's reasonable, but it doesn't communicate the road\nto the driver as well as a 1993 Ford Probe GT.  IMHO, it's much better\nthan the steering on my Celica ST.\n\n    I wonder how bad this car is during winter?\n\n\nMiscellaneous notes:\n\n    GRIPES:\n\n    The rattles from the sunroof is intermittent -- some days it rattles\n        loudly, other days I look up wondering where all the noise went.\n\n    Activating the sunroof is sometimes very noisy -- loud squealing as\n\tit retracts on its rails.  I wonder if there is a quick fix for this.\n\tAgain, other days it completely disappears.  (Function of humidity?)\n\n    Once I made the connection between the sometimes awful feeling suspension\n\tand torque steer, I've never complained about ride.\n\n    I wish the seats had more support under the thighs.  Also, I wish the\n\tside bolsters would close more tightly.  \n\n    I hear that tires for this car can get really expensive.  I\n\tcurrently have Goodyear GT+4s that cost the previous owner $500\n\tfor four.\n\n    I used to hate the Ford stereo systems -- whose idea was it\n\tto use a volume *paddle*?  Now, to my amazement, I don't\n\treally mind...  and sometimes think it's an okay idea!!!\n\tPretty ridiculous, though.\n\n    Getting up to 4000 rpm sometimes seems to be a chore.  But,\n\tthis is no big deal.  There is more than enough torque\n\tdown low.\n\n    I often goof up the shifting when driving with friends.  It\n\ttook me a couple of days before I could really shift\n\tsmoothly from 2nd to 3rd gear.  (Hard to believe, isn't it?)\n\n    My car has almost 93,000 miles on it.  My parents noted that\n\tit is almost impossible to find a low-mileage SHO. \n\tAstute observation, IMHO.  I wonder how long I can make\n\tmy SHO last -- I just bought a book titled \"Drive It Forever\"\n\tfor tips in this department.  :-)\n\n    The goofy parking brake pedal still throws me for a loop.  I once\n\tparked the car in gear, and then accidentally let out the clutch\n\tafter I started it.  The car jolted forward, and bounced off\n\tthe car in front of me -- no paint damage at all, but starting the car \n\tis a whole new ritual for me with that fangled pedal!  Also, I began \n\tto wonder how strong that brake really is.  (Today, I backed out of \n\tparking spot today and started to drive away before I noticed \n\tthe glowing brake light.  Oops.)\n\n    The driver's power window creaks when closed all the way.  The same\n    \tthing happens in my parents 1989 Mercury Sable.  Oddly, all the\n\tother windows work smoothly.\n\n\n    LIKES:\n\n    I'm liking the interior amenities more and more each day.  The\n    \tcupholders are great.\n\n    I didn't expect to use the keyless entry buttons so much, but\n\tit really is handy.  You can lock all the doors by\n\tpressing the 7/8 and 9/10 buttons together!  Neat!  And\n\tyou can never lock yourself out of the car.\n\n    I really feel like I don't deserve this car.  I really can't\n\tbelieve that I could afford it.  I got this car ten years \n\tahead of schedule.  :-)\n\n    I love this car so much that I've been telling my parents to\n\tlook into buying one.  I love this car so much that I\n\twrote this 13K file -- I meant to write a couple of lines\n\tand ended up with this.  \n\n    If there were a J.D. Powers Survey for used car owners, I would have\n\tan opportunity to express my incredible satisfaction of owning this \n\tcar.  I don't like thinking about getting another car, but at this\n\tpoint in time, I'm sure I'd buy another SHO.  For under $7000, you\n\tcan't beat it.  (Next time with an airbag and ABS, though.)\n\n    Insurance-wise, this car is also a big win.  I pay the same premiums\n\tas on my 1987 Toyota Celica -- despite that it has nearly twice\n\tthe horsepower.  \n\n\n\nOther Odds and Ends:\n\n    Much to my amazement, there is no SHO mailing list anywhere.\nMaybe because the _SHO Registry_ publication has filled this void.  I\nhaven't joined yet, but I've noticed that queries about SHOs still\nappear on rec.autos about once a month.  Owners of SHOs are always\nquick to respond, and are very vocal fans of the cars.  (Maybe some\nof the most vocal on rec.autos.  :-)\n\n    I've put together the responses to my questions about the cars, as\nwell as other posts with useful information on these cars.  I'll be \nposting this in the form of a FAQ soon.  \n\n    If anyone is interested in starting a mailing list, please speak up!\nI don't know if I have the resources here at Purdue to start one, but \nmaybe someone out there does.\n\n\nGene Kim\n()\n\n\n",

         "2 Camrys eating clutch master cyls?\n\nI have both an '84 and an '86 Camry, each with manual 5-speed transmissions.\nThe '84 has about 105,000 miles on it and the '86 about 83,000 miles.  ABout\na year ago I found that the master cylinder on the clutch in the '84 was        \nleaking fluid around the piston seal, leading to air in the system and fluid\nback into the passenger compartment of the car.  I pulled the plunger and\ngot a rebuild kit (new plunger, seal, etc.) and thought I had the problem\nlicked.  Much to my surprise, the same problem developed several months\nlater!  This time I looked carefully at the master cylinder to make sure\nthere were no scratches, burrs, or other obvious causes of the problem.  I\ndidn't find any.  Ever since I have been periodically feeding the clutch\nhydraulins additional fluid and bleeding air from the system.  I knew I\nwould be selling the car and didn't want to go all the way to solving the\nproblem.\n\nI should add that the clutch is original, and that I've had to adjust the\npedal to allow maximum extension of the piston into the master cylinder in\norder to actuate the clutch.\n\nMy hypothesis is that this means that when fully depressing the clutch pedal,\nthe angle of the piston rod (attached to the pedal) is off the axix of the\ncylinder, thus cocking the piston and seal and perhaps deforming it.\n\nWhat do you think of that as an explanation?  Can you suggest a possible fix\nshort of replacing the master cylinder and getting a new clutch put in?\n\nNow the '86: same problem, except that the above diagnosis doesn't explain\nwhy all of the fluid leaked out (by way of the master cylinder, into the\npassenger compartment) while I was on vacation for 10 days, during which\nthe clutch pedal was not depressed or otherwise caused to distort.  What\ncan you suggest here?\n\nMany thanks.  Let's hope I don't end up going to Click and Clack on this...\n\nBill Christens-Barry\n\n\n",

Shearer\n\nI do not think they can use the eavesdropping as evidence at all. However,\nusing the info they gather while listening, they can go searching THE right\nplace and find good, strong evidence, which they can use in court. \n\nQuestion : currently, it is easy to wire-tap, from the technical point of\nview, at least. Anybody using the appropriate radio receiver can listen\nto communications between a car-telephone and the ground station. The police\nalso, obviously. The clipper chip will make it much more difficult for the\nnon-authorized person to eavesdrop (note that I DO NOT write << impossible>> ).\nThe privacy will thus improve from the current situation. Poeple who REALLY\nhave something to hide already DO NOT use the phone to speak of these things.\nIf an illegal operation is really worth, one can afford having critical data\ncarried by a person rather than sending it electronically. \nThe clipper chip will not change this. \n\nThe problem is more politic. Foreign countries will never accept the clipper\nchip is the access to the escrow cannot be directly granted to their own\npolice following their OWN law, not the US law. i.e. each country will have\nits own escrow. How then will it be possible to monitor the international\ntraffic? or, will encrypted international traffic be possible ? or will there\nbe an international escrow, some kind of U.N. thing ?\n\nForbidding crypted communication is impractical: how is it possible to spot\na crypted communication in the thousands of megabytes of data which circulate\non the various existing networks. What about private networks ? And this will\nbe more and more impossible as the volume of electronic traffic will increrase\nin the next years.\n\nI think that the clipper chip can only be an interesting device to limit the\nrisk of , for instance, one's girlfriend's husband listening to his wife's\ncommunications. It will bring no more as regards to security. Is it worth ?\nI think so if its cost is limited, I think that many privacy invasions are done\nnot only by official services, but also by private entities. The clipper can\nhelp reducing these. Provided we do not hope too much of it, it is not a real\ndanger and it can be helpful.\n\nPh. HOOGVORST\n",

To get an image on the screen, you had to wait\nuntil the raster line your picture started at, load bitmaps for this line\ninto the 'sprite' registers, tell them what x positions to take, how many\nduplicates you wanted, etc, then do it all again for the next line. This\ntook all of the processor's time during the visible portion of the\ndisplay.\n\n>There was also a standard 6532 RAM, I/O, Timer (RIOT), plus a voltage\n>regulator and (if memory serves) a 555 timer.  That's all.\n\nThe RAM was mapped into the top 128 bytes of page 0, and shadowed in page\n1. The 6502 has a zero-page addressing mode on most instructions that is\nboth shorter and faster than the normal ones, so it is important on a\nmachine like this to have the scratchpad RAM in page 0. Unfortunately, it\nalso wants its stack to be in page 1 (the stack pointer is 8 bits, and the\nhigh byte of the address is hardwired to 1).\n\nThe IOT section was mapped into page 2 somewhere. 2 8 bit I/O registers\n(can't remember if each bit could be independantly set to I or O like the\n6522 and 6526), and 1(?) 8(?) bit timer with a programmable prescaler (I\nthink this was some power of 2). There were no interrupts in the system, so\nmany games would set up the timer at some known time, go away and do\nsomething else for a while, then sit and wait for the timer to run down.\n\nThere was no logic in the box to do address decoding - the RIOT had at\nleast 2 chip select pins (probably one active high, one active low), and I\nimagine the TIA was much the same. Various address lines were fed directly\nto chip selects. The 6507 likes to have ROM right at the top of memory, so\nthe 2600 had to use ROMs with active high chip selects - not exactly\nnormal, so some cartriges had a 7404 in them to convert this to the more\nusual active low chip select.\n\nJohn West\n",

Anesthetic\nagents\n>can cause confusion because the body cannot clear the medicines out\nof\n>the body as easily.\n\nThe original poster did not say why his mother had been in hospital\nbut I can answer a few general points.\n\nElderly patients may exhibit a marked difficulty in coping after\nbeing in hospital for a few days. The drastic change of environment\nwill often unmask how marginally they have been coping at home. Even\nyoung people find the change unsettling.\n\nThough we have thought that this decrement in function after - say -\nanaesthesia and surgery for a fractured hip (a common event in the\nelderly) was due to anaesthesia there is good evidence that the\nchange of situation is much more important. Some hospitals have\ntried a 'rapid transit' system for hip fractures, aiming to have the\npatient back at home within 24 hours of admission. The selection of\nthe anaesthetic has no effect on the ability to discharge these\npatients early.\n\nAnaesthetists who work with the elderly (which is almost all of us)\ngenerally take care to tailor the choice and dose of drugs used to\nthe individual patient. Even so, there is some evidence that full\nmental recovery may take a surprisingly long time to return. This is\nthe sort of thing which is detected by setting quite difficult\ntasks, not the gross change that the original poster noted.\n\nHaloperidol (Haldol TM) is a long acting drug. The plasma half life\nof the drug is up to 35 hours. If the decanoate (a sort of slow\nrelease formulation) is used it may be weeks. The elderly are\nsensitive to haloperidol for a number of reasons. Without knowing\nmore it is hard to comment.\n\nDon Mackie - his opinions\nesiology will disavow...\n",
